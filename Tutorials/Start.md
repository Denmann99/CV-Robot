# The Goal

The goal of this project is to use Object detection with a camera which would be used by a robotic arm to organize objects by either shape or color into certain areas avalible to it.

## Starting off
We have quite a few things you will need to install to get this all working properly. 

## Getting ROS2 Installed

In order to recreate our project exactly (or closely) you will need to install ROS2 on both your computer and a raspberry pi 4. 

We found the easiest way to get ROS2 working on your home compute is to use Oracle VM box and download a Debian distribution on Linux. You will also need to install a Debian Distribution onto The raspberry pi.

We used this link to get ROS2 installed

## The Robot
We decided to build our own robot modified from this open source design https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1454048
